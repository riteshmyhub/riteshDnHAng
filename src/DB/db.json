      "description": "Perfection isn’t just about looking good “on the outside.” Perfection is actually difficult to evaluate because a poor quality weld may actually look good onthe outside; it’s what you can’t see that can cause the most serious problems.\nPhoto Provided by: Means Engineering\nImperfect welds are undesirable on any job site. But they are unacceptable when the application is process piping for the food and beverage, water treatment, semiconductor, and many other industries. High-purity welding starts with proper preparation and is followed up with highly skilled process pipe and tube fabricators, using the best tools and equipment available.\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that you could get away with plugging pipes and tubes with masking tape and cardboard in order to create a dam to fill the tube with inert gas.  This process is referred to as purging or back-purging, and it’s critical to shielding the I.D. of the tube from atmosphere. And atmosphere is the enemy of quality, non-porous welds.\nToday, there are purpose-built bladders, baffles and dams engineered to help fabricators, jobsite foreman, and welding engineers get repeatable, quality welds and establish welding processes. Add an oxygen monitor that measures contamination down to the PPM, and you’ve got a kit that’s really set-up for success. Collectively, these tools take the guesswork out of the welding process and help the operator deliver consistent, food grade, high purity welds.",

      "description": "It’s not surprising— OEMS typically use welding contractors for more than welding services alone. Typically, it’s fair to expect your metal manufacturer to supply material and fabrications as well. It’s common for OEMs to request specialty welding, machining and painting services grouped together as one project.\n\nIdeally, suppliers must use their specialized knowledge to streamline welding with other manufacturing services. For instance, we work on many projects where a part may need post-weld machining using a large piece of equipment. In cases like that, it’s important that the project is optimized to save time. If the feature that needs to be machined is small, your supplier may opt to machine the component on a smaller, less expensive machine before welding. However, it must be pre-machined in a way that compensates for how welding will change and distort the part.",

      "description": "Early hydraulic cements, such as those of James Parker, James Frost and Joseph Aspdin were relatively soft and readily ground by the primitive technology of the day, using flat millstones. The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult, because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material. Because of this, cement continued to be ground very coarsely (typically 20% over 100 μm particle diameter) until better grinding technology became available. Besides producing un-reactive cement with slow strength growth, this exacerbated the problem of unsoundness. This late, disruptive expansion is caused by hydration of large particles of calcium oxide. Fine grinding lessens this effect, and early cements had to be stored for several months to give the calcium oxide time to hydrate before it was fit for sale. From 1885 onward, the development of specialized steel led to the development of new forms of grinding equipment, and from this point onward, the typical fineness of cement began a steady rise. The progressive reduction in the proportion of larger, un-reactive cement particles has been partially responsible for the fourfold increase in the strength of Portland cement during the twentieth century.[2] The recent history of the technology has been mainly concerned with reducing the energy consumption of the grinding process.",
